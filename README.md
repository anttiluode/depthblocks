# Depth Blocks 

This is a simple Python application that uses Tkinter and Matplotlib to visualize a live depth map generated by the MiDaS model. You can use either a webcam or a video file as your input source. The application provides controls to adjust various parameters such as downsample step, block size, blur sigma, zoom, background color, and playback options.
